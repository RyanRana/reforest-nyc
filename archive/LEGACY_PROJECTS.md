# Legacy Projects

This directory contains legacy projects that are separate from the main "urban futures" codebase.

## untitled folder/
A separate NYC UHI (Urban Heat Island) prediction system with its own CLI and utilities. This project:
- Has its own data pipeline and models
- Uses H3 hexagonal grids for spatial analysis
- Includes Earth-2 integration for temperature predictions
- Has separate utilities and configuration

**Status**: Separate project, not actively integrated with urban futures

## leap 2/
A separate project related to climate simulation (LEAP - Low-Energy Architecture Planning). Contains:
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- Setup guides and documentation
- Separate requirements and structure

**Status**: Separate project, not actively integrated with urban futures

## Migration Scripts
Root-level Python scripts that were used for one-time data migration:
- `enhance_urban_futures.py` - Enhanced urban futures with temperature data
- `translate_untitled_to_urban_futures.py` - Translated data formats
- `use_urban_futures_priority.py` - Used priority scores for analysis

**Status**: One-time use scripts, archived for reference
